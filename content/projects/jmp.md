title: "Industrial Robots and Infant Mortality in Mexico (Job Market Paper)"
summary: "Abstract: Over the last three decades, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of automation practices, especially among industrialized economies. One form of automation comes from using industrial robots in manufacturing industries. Recent research for both developed and developing countries has shown job displacements, as the capital share of firms increases at the expense of fewer workers. Are there any consequences beyond the labor market? In this paper, I study the effect of U.S. robot adoption on infant mortality in Mexico, where a large share of export-oriented workers are women. The impact of automation on infant health is consistent with the literature that documents a countercyclical pattern of infant health among developing countries. These increases are attributable to behavioral responses to adverse income shocks, while the role of selection is potentially limited."
