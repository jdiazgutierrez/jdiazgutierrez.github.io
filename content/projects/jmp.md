title: "Automation, Economic Shocks, and Infant Mortality: Evidence from Mexico"
summary: "Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the impact of increased robotics in the United States on infant mortality rates in Mexico. Using a shift-share design that leverages variations in industrial robot usage and the employment composition of export-oriented maquiladoras, which predominantly employ women, I find that regions with higher exposure to U.S. automation experienced a greater rise in infant mortality rates. The analysis shows that women in manufacturing faced more significant job losses than men, leading to reduced household income and access to employer-provided healthcare. This economic strain forced many women into self-employment, reducing time for childcare. Additionally, I present evidence suggesting that automation may increase risky behaviors, such as drinking and smoking, among uninsured women of childbearing age. These findings highlight the complex relationship between technological advancements and public health outcomes, emphasizing the need for policymakers to consider the cross-border effects of automation on global health and employment."
