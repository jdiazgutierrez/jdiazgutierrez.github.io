title: "Industrial Robots and Infant Mortality in Mexico"
summary: "Abstract: This paper examines the impact of increasing robotics in the United States on infant mortality in Mexico by leveraging variation in industrial robot usage within manufacturing industries and the baseline composition of employment in export-oriented maquiladoras, which are predominantly staffed by women. The analysis reveals that regions with greater exposure to U.S. automation experienced a more significant rise in infant mortality rates. Exploring the underlying mechanisms, I find that women in manufacturing industries suffered greater employment losses compared to men, which also led to a relative decline in household income. These job losses resulted in reduced access to employer-provided healthcare and less time available for childcare, as women sought to offset the loss of manufacturing jobs by moving into self-employment within the same sector. Additionally, I provide suggestive evidence that automation may increase risky behaviors, such as drinking and smoking, among uninsured women of childbearing age. These findings are consistent with the countercyclical pattern of infant mortality observed in developing countries."
