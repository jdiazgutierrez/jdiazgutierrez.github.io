title: "Trade Effects on Substance Abuse: Evidence from Colombia's Liberalization"

summary: "Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of a structural tariff reform on substance abuse in Colombia. Using administrative data on the universe of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, I find that municipalities potentially more exposed to trade exhibit relative increases in total substance abuse. I show that these results are not explained by pre-trends in substance abuse rates, and that increases in substance abuse may be mediated by a stress channel through losses in the labor market. The  findings hold when employing a broad array of robustness checks."
