title: "Trade Effects on Substance Abuse: Evidence from Colombia's Liberalization (*Under Review*)"

summary: "Abstract: This paper examines the impact of trade liberalization on substance abuse in a developing country context. I study a unilateral reform implemented in Colombia in 2010, which reduced tariffs in the manufacturing and mining sectors. Using a Bartik-style measure of local exposure based on pre-reform employment composition and a continuous-treatment difference-in-differences design, I link tariff cuts to municipality-level rates of substance abuse between 2009 and 2014. The analysis relies on administrative health data covering the universe of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, allowing me to capture both intensive (patients) and extensive (services) margins and to distinguish by substance type. I find that municipalities more exposed to the reform experienced statistically significant increases in substance abuse relative to less exposed areas. The effects are driven by alcohol and cocaine, and are more pronounced among middle-aged individuals and women. Evidence from matched employment data suggests that labor market disruptions are a key mechanism. The findings highlight previously overlooked health externalities of trade policy."
