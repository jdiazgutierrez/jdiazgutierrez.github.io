Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, expecting to graduate in May 2026. I am on the job market for the 2025-2026 academic year.

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in health, development, and labor economics, with a secondary field in environmental economics. My research examines how economic shocks—from automation and trade liberalization to immigration policy—affect health outcomes, labor markets, and development in Latin America. My job market paper investigates how increased U.S. industrial automation impacts infant mortality in Mexico through labor market disruptions in export-oriented manufacturing.

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/lac/brief/lac-chief-economist) in the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as with the Department of Economics at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/economiayfinanzas) and the [Centro de Estudios Regionales del Magdalena Medio (CER)](https://cer.org.co/).
