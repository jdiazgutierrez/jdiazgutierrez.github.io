My research focuses on the intersection of health, labor, and international trade. Currently, I am exploring the determinants of health disparities in developing countries. Specifically, my work examines the impact of automation on infant health outcomes in Mexico, the effects of trade liberalization on substance abuse, and the influence of high-intensity conflict de-escalation on birth outcomes in Colombia.

Prior to joining the [University of Illinois](https://ace.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-degrees/doctor-philosophy-agricultural-and-applied-economics), I worked as a research analyst for the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America and the Caribbean at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/lac/brief/lac-chief-economist), the Department of Economics at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/economiayfinanzas), and the [Centro de Estudios Regionales del Magdalena Medio (CER)](https://cer.org.co/).
